Laptop Price Predictor


There are many laptop manufacturers who are unwilling to share information about their products, so consumers are often unable to make accurate comparisons of prices. In this project, we propose to develop a machine learning-based laptop price predictor that can estimate the price of a laptop based on its specifications using machine learning techniques. Our approach is essentially the collection of data pertaining to laptop specifications and prices, followed by training a machine learning model to predict laptop prices based on these specifications. The following sections will explore machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and K neural networks. This is so we can determine which is the most accurate at predicting the future.
We will evaluate our model's performance on a separate laptop specifications and prices dataset. We will compare the predicted prices with the actual prices to measure our predictions' accuracy. Finally, we will develop a web application that allows users to input laptop specifications and receive an estimated price based on our model.
The significance of our project lies in the fact that it solves a common problem faced by consumers when shopping for laptops - the lack of transparency in pricing when comparing laptops and their options. As a result of developing a machine learning-based laptop price predictor, we empower consumers to make informed purchase decisions without relying solely on manufacturers' information.

This is a machine learning project that predicts the price of a laptop based on its features. It uses a dataset of laptops from various brands and with various specifications to train a regression model that can predict the price of a laptop given its features.

Installation
To run this project, you will need to install Python and the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
You can install these libraries using pip:


pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib


Once you have installed the libraries, you can run the project by executing the app.py script.

Usage
To use the laptop price predictor, simply input the features of the laptop you want to predict the price of into the predict_price function in the app.py file.
The features should be in the form of a pandas DataFrame with the following columns:
Laptop company,
type of laptop,
Ram size,
operating system, 
weight, 
touchscreen, 
IPS, 
PPI, 
CPU Name,
HDD, 
SSD,
GPU brand.

It is a dataset processing process using Jupyter Notebook. First, load the data and import the libraries. After that, they will learn how to understand data and visualization. Finally, obtaining the data is an essential step in the prediction process.
In an exploratory analysis, all data and relationships are explored and understood so that features can be engineered, relationships between data components need to be visualized, and machine learning models can be simplified and streamlined for prediction and accuracy.
Several regression models will be tested for their R2 scores and mean absolute scores. Choosing one regression model from so many options is difficult for them. We will train our data with different regression models to determine which model has the maximum accuracy and the most minor errors.
Implementation plan for your laptop price predictor deploys web using Streamlit and deployment using Heroku:
1.	Project setup:
o	Create a new project directory and initialize a virtual environment.
o	Install the necessary packages and dependencies (including Streamlit).
o	Set up a Git repository to track changes in the code.

2.	Data Collection and Cleaning:
o	Gather the laptop data from a reliable source from Kaggle.
o	Perform data cleaning and data preprocessing to ensure consistency in the dataset.
o	Remove any missing values, duplicate values, or irrelevant columns.

3.	Exploratory Data Analysis:
o	Conduct comprehensive data analysis to identify patterns, trends, and relationships.
o	Visualize the data to gain insights and better understand the dataset.
o	Identify features highly correlated with the target variable (price).
4.	Model Training:
o	• Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm such as linear regression, random forest, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest.
o	• Divide the data into training and testing sets (15% for testing and 85% for training).
o	o Train the model on the training data and assess its performance on the testing data.
o	o Refine the model by adjusting its parameters to enhance its performance.

5.	Model Deployment:
o	Build a Streamlit application that uses the trained model to predict the laptop price.
o	Deploy the Streamlit application on Heroku.
o	Test the deployed application to ensure that it is functioning correctly.
o	Make the necessary updates to the code and redeploy the application if needed.
6.	Monitoring and Maintenance:
o	Monitor the application's performance and usage metrics to identify potential issues or bottlenecks.
o	Fix any issues as soon as they arise.
o	Update the application and model as needed to ensure that they remain up-to-date and relevant.
7.	Future Improvements:
o	Consider incorporating additional features or data sources to improve the accuracy of the model.
o	Add user authentication to prevent unauthorized access to the application.
o	Integrate with a database to store user data and model predictions for future use.
